##Writing and Reflection on Problem/Challenge. 

**GOAL:** The aim is to clarify your thinking about the problem or challenge, and in doing so, improve your project. You’ll be leaving aside your solution or project idea for about a half hour, and focusing the problem only. Your solution will be most effective if you’ve got a good grasp on the ins and outs of the problem, why it exists, what other solutions have been tried, etc. Here are some little exercises to get you going. (note: After you complete these exercises, you’ll write a blog post about your problem/challenge for the MSL blog. The post itself doesn’t have to be structured in this way, but doing about 30 mins of short writing exercises will provide you with material for your final draft.)

**FORMAT:** Solo writing exercise.  Use all of the time you’re allotted for each exercise. If you get stuck, try to keep going. Keeping your pen moving, free associate, don’t be judgemental, encourage any idea or thought that comes to mind. 

**TECHNOLOGY:** A timer or stopwatch to time your freewrites. Pen and paper are recommended here, over typing into a computer. 

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 30 to 35 mins 

1. **Free-write: Problem/Challenge (5 mins).** Remember, don’t start with the solution you’re imagining here, only the problem you want it to address. Try phrasing  your problem in jargon-free language, and be sure you’re defining all terms plainly-- what ie: what does “open” mean in this case? Take a step back and look at the roots of the problem. What’s contributing or compounding it. Are there underlying causes you need to consider, to be sure you’re targeting your solution effectively? 
	* I'm a person, who is working in the science and design space and I just want to contribute to making those things more readable, understandable, and doable. 
	* I see a lot of cool things I want to do, specifically when it comes to science communication, but sometimes it is hard because it is not really clear how to get from A to B. 
	* <!--For me, the problem feels like having good examples of people and materials that help get people to understan-->
	* For me, the problem I encounter time and time again is:
		* where are all the good examples that I can deconstruct to do these "cool things".
		* if there are examples out there, how come they are so hard to read and interpret? and how can I make them better so that others don't get as confused?
		* how can I contribute?
		* how can I share this knowledge so that others can make those things that are relevant for them?
		* and how can I address all these questions so that it makes it easier for people to communicate their work?

(~ 10 mins)		

2. **Free-write: Scope and Scale (5 mins).**  Consider the decisions you’ve made (if any) about scope and scale (for example: “among undergraduates” or “in the UK.”) . Take the problem and shift your scope and scale (zoom in/out) to focus on a larger or smaller subset of users or behaviors. What changes when you do this?  What feels most manageable? What feels too complex, or too general? Are you seeing new audiences or users you didn’t imagine?
	* In terms of scope, these challenges of not having good examples to work with means that people feel incredibly frustrated with: 1. trying to make the things they want, and 2. feel discouraged about the things they make because they aren't fully realized / are half baked and 3. feel discouraged from contributing because they don't know how to make those examples better or how they would even flag that those examples are confusing. I think these frustrations scale up from the individual all the way up to communities of people and detract from people making things.
	* I think this is a challenge that can be addressed both at the level of individual learning and at the level of teaching. I think these challenges point to a missing roadmap or pathway with which a person or class can see how they can build the things they want, deconstruct those examples, and make new things and more examples.

3. **Refine.  (3-5 minutes).** Take a moment to narrow your problem statement down to one or two sentences.
	* My challenge statement: I believe that challenge is that we just don't have good "maps" or examples to inspire, motivate, and empower people to build the things they want to build and contribute in the places they want to contribute. I see the challenge as addressing issues of inclusivity and accessibility by making examples of how to make the process of taking an idea at point A and building on it to get to point B, legible. 

4. **Reflect (2-5 mins).** Are you finding any  gaps in your understanding of the problem, your users, etc? Is research needed? List 3-5 areas where you might need more.
	* I see some gaps in my understanding of the problem lying in the fact that people approach problems differently, they learn differently, and what might be a good example to one person might not be a good example for another. I decision about approaching a problem like this is making decisions about how to be inclusive and make examples that beginners can learn from and use and that experts can appreciate and reference.
	* some areas I could use some help in are learning more about user experiences, communication of information, metaphors and abstraction, and detailing steps and instructions.

5. **Brainstorm (2-5 mins).** Think of analogs. What are similar problems in other fields? What solutions have been tried? Did they work? Why/Why not? 
	* I see this challenge of participation and inclusivity a problem in other fields where the final results (whether it is a visualization or an installation, etc) obscure the process of making those results tangible. Essentially, I see that regardless of the field, many people learn by example and without having good examples it is difficult to build on the existing knowledge. 
	* There are lots of solutions out there, in the form of tutorials, books, videos, etc. A lot are effective.
	* A few good examples are: Generative Design (book), Visual Grammar (book), the cartodb academy, codeschool/codeacademy/freecodecamp (all those online code teaching tutorials), dan shiffman & all his content he produces. I think if I can draw on these examples and use them in the context of science communication and specifically mapping, I could develop and one possible interesting solution to the challenge of not having coherent and good examples for making things and contributing. 

6. **Free-write: Transformation (5 mins).**  If this problem is solved, what does that look like? What do people do differently? What are the effects one week, one month, one year, ten years after this problem is solved? How does this change the transform the  broader culture? (Again, skip the solution for now and try to imagine only the outcome).
	* If this problem is solved, I would love if this meant that people who want to make a map for the web - whether it be to display their scientific information or collect data or whatever - can do so while learning how to code, problem solve, and remix those examples in the process to make something even bigger, better, more beautiful, and better. People would feel confident in their ability to figure out a solution to their mapping needs (and science tool making/communication in general) and be able teach eachother how to go through the process of making those things to others. 
	* This would change the broader culture by making the process of making and understanding the geo web more legible for all people trying to work with maps and data online.
	* of critical importance is to change the way mapping is taught in unversities and to give people the confidence and skills to turn their (geographic) ideas into reality.
