# Richard Interview Blog Post:
2016-01-04

Rik is that kid in school that never listened to the rules and always got into trouble. He is that person your parents would never let you hang out with not because he's dangerous, but because he's principled. Rik may have been a troublemaker in his past, but is now harnessing that energy to make science more accessible and diverse and just more enjoyable to do.

This interview is a collection of exerpts from an interview I conducted with Rik when we both started our Mozilla Science Fellowship.

#### Romantic Cowboy in Africa

**Joey:** All right. So, you know, the basic stuff just to get started. Can you introduce yourself? 

**Rik:** I'm Richard Smith-Unna. I'm from West of London in Guilford and Surrey, but currently living in Essex, UK with my fiancé, son, and 3 cats and dog, just 20 miles from Cambridge. 

**Joey:** And you're a biologist, hacker, and PhD student. Can you explain a bit about how you came to be those things?

**Rik:** "There was never any plan. As a child I was good at school, but I strongly resented adults who told me that I had to follow rules but wouldn't explain why the rules were the way that they were. I was very naughty at school [laughs]."

"My school years were just irrelevant to my education, which occurred almost entirely outside school... as a teenager, I was very, very interested in computers. [Though] honestly I felt at the time that I could learn computer science in my spare time without going to university and not bother with the  stress of having to apply to universities. So I didn't go."

"Eventually I ended up going to South Africa where I was offered to go for several months and work as a wildlife photographer to document a game reserve before it was open to the public. I was in the right place at the right time. I got to take pictures of animals and just have a really cool time following around a conservation biologist. He would race around the wilderness with radio tracking equipment and a gun and be looking for rhino and elephant and other animals. To me that was just the most romantic idea of what you could possibly do with your life. I just thought, 'If I can do this for the rest of my life, I’ll be happy.' That's how I felt at the age of about 21."

"And so I decided to come back to the UK and study conservation biology. I went to University of Western England and did a conservation biology BSc where I actually discovered that I'm really an academic, which I hadn't really realized before. I love thinking and learning and organizing my knowledge and all these things that academics do. So there I was (at university) as a sort of early 20's person who'd suddenly discovered a love for knowledge. Every summer and holiday, I was doing research projects with different lecturers and researchers - they were all very supportive and generous. I think they were just pleased to have someone who was really interested and not just trying to party. I worked either full or part time the entire time through university to support myself... I did software development, some ecological surveying, and a year in industry working at the Millennium Seed Bank."

**Joey:** So after your bachelors and your time working, what happened?

**Rik:** "I'm a very strategic person. I thought very carefully about the balance of what my interests were. Fundamentally, I wanted to do a PhD because I wanted to be a scientist. I wanted to save the world. I wanted to make the world a better place. And I thought, 'What I should try and do is find a lab whose work could potentially change the world, but where they're probably held back by the lack of the kind of skills that I have'. 

**Joey:** And then you found Cambridge?

**Rik:** "So I did this several months long analysis where I would read articles in the scientific literature and the press about projects that were expected to have a huge impact on the world. What kind of aspects of agriculture, for example, were we expecting to struggle with in the future, and what research projects were tackling those.  I was looking for people who had lots of resources but what were lacking the expertise that I thought I might be able to provide. And I narrowed it down basically to the [C4 Rice project](http://c4rice.irri.org/) and a couple of other crop engineering projects, because they were doing a lot of plant physiology stuff, measuring plants on a large scale, and none of them seemed to have any programmers. And I thougt, 'Well, they're going to have huge amounts of data. Surely my vague skill set (programming and hacking) will come in handy.' And then, I emailed. The only one who gave me a polite reply was my current supervisor, so I chose C4."

**Joey:** Along with your work on photosynthesis, you're quite active and vocal in the open science community. Can you explain your relationship with open science?

**Rik:** "I came into science, first of all, through just wanting to be a romantic cowboy in Africa. And once I'd scrapped that idea, I realized that even on a small time scale, say, five years, applying a scientific breakthrough in agriculture can literally alleviate starvation or malnutrition on a massive scale and make a difference in children dying and/or growing up with serious life-destroying diseases... I'm not so sure that science could really save humanity from any sort of apocalyptic disaster [laughs] but it could make people's lives much better in the really quite immediate future." 

"However throughout my PhD, I became more and more aware, to the point where it dominated my worldview, that actually science is really quite badly broken in various ways. Systematically broken. And is being exploited on a massive scale to the detriment of humanity, society, and science itself."

"I believe it is our responsibility as scientists, as people who want the intellectual freedom to study the world to make sure that (public) money (from taxpayers and grants) is being spent effectively and that it is spent in such a way that the public can get some kind of value back. I think at the moment we are failing completely to do that." 

**Joey:** What do you think is "breaking" science? 

**Rik:** "I began thinking about how can we design science to perform the role that society believes it's getting in return for its massive, absolutely vast historical and current investment in science. Because if we as scientists say science needs to be funded more, then we can't do that in good conscience if we then throw wads of money at companies who are producing pathetically valueless products like publishers or people who make scientific machinery who have just insane markups for things which are actually trivial to do. They've managed to milk science so systematically by getting in early before it was trivially easy to do those things and monopolize all these different streams of money that are going into science."

"These science monopolies are the most important node in a huge network of problems in science; they affect the incentives, which change the way that scientists act. It affects science culture because we're so controlled by publishers and the people who take money from us, and by the people who give money to us such as grant-awarding bodies. The way that scientists behave is almost completely predetermined by the rules of that system, which are all terrible. It's been very difficult for anyone to break through those monopolies."

**Joey:** So you're saying that to do good science, you first need to fix science?

**Rik:** "So my career from now until it's getting to a satisfactory level, has to be primarily about making science work right because I would love to be a good scientist. But I can't in good conscience focus on being a scientist when we're wasting everybody's money and doing much worse science than we could otherwise be doing. So yes, we need to fix things. "


#### Hip-hop hacker

**Joey**: Let's switch gears a bit. I know you're a big fan of hip-hop. Can you talk about how you see how hip-hop and science are related?

**Rik:** "Hip-hop has multiple elements, like rapping, MCing, and DJing. In many ways they are about exploring the history of your own culture. Hip hop is about creating new expressions from the things that have been expressed in the past and combining them with the things you want to express now. It's really about respecting what people have done before you, respecting the creativity and intelligence of people who have come before you, taking what they've done that you think is amazing and using it to create something that is incrementally getting more and more amazing as time goes by. "

"Respecting the history of your culture is a huge thing in hip-hop. It's extremely similar to science where citation. Showing the origin of your ideas, and the facts and ideas that you've used to reach your conclusion, that is exactly what's happening in a hip-hop song when a DJ mixes together samples. It's a way of saluting people who come before."

"Hip-hop has a lot of connections to programming as well. Programming has a history of citation, of respecting what has come before by reusing code that other people have written. But more interestingly, hip-hop is algorithmic. So hip-hop is about 'I create something small and clever, and I repeat it in a certain way', which is fundamentally how programming works."


**Joey:** That's amazing. But yet there are still big differences?

**Rik:** "So something that is true in hip-hop, which is not true in science, is that really anyone can be involved in hip-hop. Science does not have that. Science has a very strong exclusivity about it. Science thinks it's more important than it is, and the people in it think they're more important than they are."

"But fundamentally, [in hip-hop] it doesn't matter how cool you are. It doesn't matter what color you are. It doesn't matter what education you've got. Hip-hop is just a way of telling people about anything that you want to say, and it brings with it a very rich cultural history that involves respecting what's come before. Science has the rich cultural history of what's come before. What it doesn't have is that anyone can get into it regardless of their economic status, education, race, color, all of these things. We have a severe access problem in science and I actually think that hip-hop is quite a nice route into solving that problem."


**Joey:** Clearly you've thought a lot about this! Do you also see relationships between hacking and science? 

**Rik:** "Hacking values knowledge, especially knowledge that has never been previously discovered. You have to do something fundamentally clever that astound people around you by how clever it is, you have to think of things that nobody's thought of before, or at least things that nobody's expecting. That's really what we have to do in science as well and it can take an incredible amount of ingenuity and research. The skills are really quite mappable between science and hacking. But the rewards are quite different, I would say."

**Joey:** How so?

**Rik:** "The big difference between scientists and hackers is that in science, there is a pool of funding. People have lives and they have to support their families and themselves. At the end of the day, they will compromise for the incentives. They will compromise so that they can have a roof to sleep under. Hacking tends to be done by people who don't need to make that kind of compromise, for whatever reason. Hackers are generally people who are not motivated by money; they're motivated by discovery, intellectual curiosity, and often hatred of authority."

**Joey:** What would you be doing if you weren't studying plants and advocating for open science?

**Rik**: "I think authority is just about the worst thing ever. A lot of my behavior gets driven by this kind of very deep reactionary flipping out that happens when people of authority try to impose their values and systems onto me or others, especially when those values and systems are flawed. What happens too often is that some person in charge sets some rules that restricts us from doing the one thing that would benefit society. That really riels me up and it also gets my creative juices flowing and tends to make me find ways to get around the system."

"In all honesty, I think I would be some kind of criminal. I'd probably be in jail."

**Joey:** Well, we're all happy you've decided to use your powers for good. We need more hip-hop hackers.

**Rik:** Thank you, Joey.
