### Learning Bank (new name in the works)
***
tags:

- education

#### Motivation:

Learning is best achieved when we have domain specific examples to work with 

#### What is Learning Bank?

- Learning Bank is browser based/desktop tool that you can drag and drop links that feeds into a database of resources for learning tools/skills - e.g. how to make a web map with javascript, how to run a T-test in R, etc. 
- Learning Bank uses web scraping to try and pull out the relevant programmng language and also the subject/data type the tutorial is working on. 
- users can then browse learning by langugage but also domain or data examples that are relevant for them.
- The idea then is that PrismDB will become a big database of helpful links and tutorials that are relevant for learning new skills and tools, etc that can be navigated and filtered in an enjoyable way.
- Ultimately PrismDB is a database of domain examples so that we can learn with the data and things that align closest to us. 
- Other technical notes:
- we then create a backup of the reference to save the content
- duplicate links without new content won't be saved - but upvoted - only if content has changed then we can keep the data.

### Sketching Web Geography

#### Motivation:

- GIS education in universities is broken - we rely on proprietary tools, antiquated and boring examples, point-and-click software that lead to PDFs for sharing outputs.
- This is so lame and leading to a whole generation of confused and ill-functioning students.
- Also, the future of GIS is in the web - it's already happening (e.g. CartoDB), but there's a lot more to be explored.
- Sketching Web Geography?
- Sketching Web Geography is a web-based book that is aimed to protoype a new aspect of geo education - GIS meets the web. 
- Fundamental to this geo education is to integrate programming and the idea of sketching with code to build web based maps. 
- I propose to use modern web technologies such as P5.js, Leaflet.js, Turf.js, D3.js, and Github, and others, to put together a book that tries to capture the lego block approach to building and making things - in this case maps - with code.
- The book would start with P5 - learning the basics of the web then move to integrating maps.
- Each chapter is a lesson - e.g. intro to computation, geo data formats, making a map UI, etc.
- Best feature: a "lookbook" section that takes scientific data on real and relevant projects and explains how they are made and how to pull together the lessons from the book to make them.
