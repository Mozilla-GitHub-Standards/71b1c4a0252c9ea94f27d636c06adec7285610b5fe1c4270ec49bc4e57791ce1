###RESOURCES REQUIREMENTS & SUSTAINABILITY PLAN

**GOAL:** This excise will help you scope out the resources you'll need to work openly and transparently on your project. By considering these upfront, you'll be better equiped to collaborate with others and share out your progress.

**FORMAT:** Checklist. Go through each section and decide what is applicable and needed for your project. Write these down.

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 30 mins - 1 hour.

**TECHNOLOGY:** Your favourite text editor and Markdown. Record and share your findings in your GitHub repository. Either as a file, or in a GitHub issue

###RESOURCES

Go through these sections, *people*, *process*, *technology* and *physical*, and record the resources you'll need to work on your fellowship project. If you need funding for any of these, add a note.

####PEOPLE
What kind of contributors will you need?
* What expertise are you looking for? List them all out. 
  - [ ] UX Designers, 
  - [ ] JavaScript developers, 
  - [ ] Alzheimer specialists, 
  - [ ] others
* These experts can all contribute in differnt ways. What roles are you looking for?
  - [ ] Testing. Do you need input from testers as you build?
  - [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Input
  - [ ] Development

####PROCESS
Part of working open is creating processess that allow outsiders to contribute to your project. How will you bring in contributors? How will you share progress and work openly? Write down which processess you'll need to implement as part of your open source project.

**Communicating progress openly**
* Sharing progress / work done
  * Regular blogging, twitter, available source code
  
**Working with contributors**
* Onboarding contributors
  * What process does someone go through to become a contributor? (CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Review process for new code / other contributions
  * This includes setting up the process, writing it down and communicating it to contributors
* Providing help
  * Where can others go to ask questions and get help?

**Contributor pathway / Sustainability plan**

You probably won't be available to run this project forever. Will you need to start finding contributors who could take on project maintenance? If so, you'll need processess that identify good contributors, encourage and reward them and increasingly delegate project maintenance responsibilities.
* Identifying and encouraging good contributors
  * Recognition (public thanks, swag), increase permissions (commit privilege, module maintenance), delegate responsibility
* Delegation
  * At what point will you grant commit privilege? module maintenance? project maintenance?

####TECHNOLOGY
What technology will you need to build out and share your project? 
* Hardware
  * What do you need for development?
  * Server space *(funding)*
* System architecture
  * Node, react, other. This can be higher level for now.
* Domain name *(funding)*
* Blogging platform *(maybe funding)*
* Twitter account

####PHYSICAL
Most of these should be taken care of during your fellowship, but just in case:
* Workspace
* Phone line
* Promotional Materials *(funding)*
