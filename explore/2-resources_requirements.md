##Resource Requirements.

**GOAL:** This exercise will help you identify resources you'll need to sucessfully complete your project. By considering all potential needs for your project up-front, you'll be able better plan and scope your work, and begin to explore where and how you'll get needed resources, from funding streams to people who contribute skills and expertise. 

You'll avoid roadblocks and wasted time that can occur when resources aren't in place to when they're needed. 

**FORMAT:** Resource Requirements document.

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 30 mins - 1 hour.

**TECHNOLOGY:** Your favorite text editor and Markdown. Record and share your findings in your GitHub repository.

Go through each of the following sections --people/skills, technology, and physical/material resources-- and record what you'll reuquire to complete your project. If you think you'll need funding for any of these, highlight them or add a note.


###PEOPLE/SKILLS
What kind of contributors will you need? What expertise or skills are necessary? For instance, many software projects may benefit from user experience designers or graphic desginers. Curriculum design projects will benefit from review by other skilled instructors. You may want to enlist the help of writers or social media experts to help communicate your project publicly.

Resist the temptation to wear all hats on a project! You may be handy with Photoshop or Illustrator or D3.js, but bringing on volunteers who have those specialized skills will broaden your community of contributors and bring your project to new audiences with fresh perspectives. 

List all the people you'll need onboard to complete your project (and don't forget to add the end users, and include yourself!). Now, take each person/type listed and add the kinds of contributions (output/input) you hope they'll provide, and list the hours you expect you'll need to complete this work. Be realistic about your asks -- you may not find a developer with 40 hours to contribute, but you may know a few people who could contribute shorter chunks of time. 

You should come up with a matrix that is structured like this:  


**SAMPLE MATRIX:**

Role | Output/Input | Hours Needed (per week) | Who Can Help? | Notes
---- |------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -----
JS Developer| D3 Code for Visualizations  | 30 hrs | Alice | contact her ASAP
Graphic Designer | Logo and Diagrams | 15 hrs |? ask MSL staff? | how much do designers charge?
QA Testers | Testing | 4 testers @ 2 hrs each | Email listserv for volunteers | QA will happen over spring break, students free to help? 
Users| Use the app! | ongoing, but 1 hour intial engagement | Open Data Community |need PR plan to publicize

Remember you have some of the time and energy of Mozilla Science Lab staff members available to support your project. Add Kaitlin, Abby, Arliss, Steph, Zannah, and Aurelia to your matrix-- we can provide feedback, tech support, project management or community management consultations, etc.  

We are also happy to connect you to people who can help from the wider Mozilla Foundation and Corporation. 

###TECHNOLOGY
What technologies will you need to build out your project, maintain it, and build a community of users? 

List everything you'll need-- from GitHub accounts, to any special hardware or developement environment you'll need to work, to server space and domain names. You may need some communications tools, like blogs or twitter accounts. Note if you'll need funds to maintain any of these services going forward (especially if you plan for your project to be active for years). Create a list for each category, and add additonal catagories if need be. 

If you find a matrix format is more useful here (add columns for costs, etc) go ahead and create that structure.

###PHYSICAL/MATERIAL RESOURCES

You may already have physical resources like a phone line and workspace taken care of via the Fellowship, but if you expect to host a Sprint, training or other event, you'll need a physical meeting space and materials like signs, fliers, refreshments, and swag for your event. You may also want to give t-shirts or stickers to recognize the work of excellent contrbutions. Make a matrix (see above in People/Skills) of any physical resources and materials you'll need, the amount, the costs, and how you might source them.
