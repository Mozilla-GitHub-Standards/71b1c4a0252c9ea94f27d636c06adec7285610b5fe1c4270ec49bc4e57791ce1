## Developing an Elevator Pitch

**WHAT IS AN ELEVATOR PITCH?**  
An elevator pitch is a brief, persuasive speech that you use to spark interest in an organization, project, idea, product or yourself in the time it takes to ride the elevator from the ninth floor to the lobby (20-30 seconds) where the target of your pitch leaves through the lobby and rides away.
Key points of the elevator pitch are to be:

* succinct - stick to key points that will make the most impact
* interesting - what will make your 30 seconds of fame memorable?
* understandable - listeners should be actively listening to you, not trying to figure out what you mean

**GOAL:** We want you to be able to build community and buzz around your projects.  With busy schedules and other work projects competing for attention, it can be difficult to get someone to sit down and have a conversation.  Having a succinct, memorable way to explain what you’re doing and WHY you’re doing it can get people to stop, listen, and even share your passion.  At the end of this exercise you should have a 30 second to one minute “elevator pitch” to get people excited about what you’re doing.

**FORMAT:** Solo writing combined with oral practice.  **You will give your polished pitch to the Mozilla Science Lab team on the January 6th, 2016 Fellows call.**

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 50 mins - 1 hr 15 mins

**TECHNOLOGY:** A timer or stopwatch to time your pitch. Pen and paper or your favorite text editor.  Skype or Google Hangouts for pitching to friends, family, Fellows.  Video is recommended over just audio so body language and eye contact can be practiced along with the text of the pitch.

### PROCESS:  
**A. Compose your message. (10-15 minutes)**

Take a few minutes to write a few sentences about your project.  Think about your goal.  What message are you trying to get across to your listeners?  What will get them excited about your project?
For this first part, don’t worry about the length of your message.  Be sure to answer these questions:
* Who are you?
* What are you doing? What problem does your project address?
* What is the impact of what you're doing? Why is it important?
* Have others tried to solve this problem? How is your project different?

Take what you've written down and condense it into 3-4 sentences or less.
Having trouble condensing it that much?  Try these tips:

* Delete words that are redundant. E.g. “completely free” when just saying “free” is enough.
* Look carefully at your adverbs and adjectives.  Are they necessary for you to get your point across?  Are there stronger, less wordy alternatives that would work better?
* Try rearranging your words in a manner that allows you to use less of them.
* There are a couple articles linked in the “Helpful Resources” section at the bottom that have some more advice.

**B. Set the tone and review your language. (10-15 minutes)**

Review your text.
* Your pitch should reflect your passion and commitment to your project.
* Make it conversational yet professional.  
* Make sure your words are easy to understand by a wide audience with variable levels of understanding of your topic. Remember the jargon-busting exercise? (http://mozillascience.github.io/open-science-leadership-workshop/de-jargonizing_activity.html)

Set your stopwatch/timer for 60 seconds and try it out.  
Once you get it to 60 seconds, take a look at your text and see if you can get it down to 45 or 30 seconds.

**C. Practice, practice, practice. (30-45 minutes)**

Now that you have your first draft, take it and pitch it to your friends, colleagues and family.  (They’ll love you for it.)

Some specific feedback you can request (or add your own):
* Did you sound natural?
* Were they able to understand what you were doing?
* Could they grasp the impact of your work?
* Did you leave them wanting to know more?

Based on what you learned from your feedback, refine your pitch again and take it to your “pitch partner” listed below.  Set up a time where you can pitch to each other over Vidyo, Skype, Google Hangouts… some method where you can see each other.

Refine your pitch again based on your Fellow partner feedback.

How do you feel about your pitch?  Has this process helped you clarify your goals for the project?  Do you feel like you could start up a conversation about your project at your next cocktail party?

Now you’re ready to pitch it to the Mozilla Science Lab team at the **January 6** call!
