# re: interview editing. 

These interviews are LONG! But they are super fascinating and it's great to hear the conversations and you speaking in your own words. 

For the blog post, you're welcome to improvise a bit, but this is what I was thinking...

* Go through the interview and highlight your favorite parts of the conversation. The big ideas that came out and the stuff you thought was most exciting.
* Edit that BEST stuff down. We all repeat ourselves. drift off on tangents, re-form and re-phrase ideas as we're speaking. So the editing process is pulling out the most interesting, well-said sections. 
* You may highlight some things at the expense of other ideas as you do this, but as long as you are not misrepresenting an idea that is generally OK. 
* As a sample, here's a google doc where I edited [part of Joey's interview with Richard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otKoTuLaU-adP9oVzr5WdmyEkH4HFo_GlQM9eiaiSXw/edit?usp=sharing). 
	* You can see that I'm focusing more on the Richard's self-directed experience of learning, and less on his parent's influence or his school environment. I've taken out big chunks to make that idea come forward.
* once you have these big ideas (maybe there are 3 or 4 in each interview), and have edited the transcript of your interviewee down to a page or less for each idea, you can:
	1. write a few sentences of intro for each section, 
	2. plus a short intro to the interview... and you're done!

this is what I'd had in mind... let me know if that makes sense.
