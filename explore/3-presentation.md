## Presentation:
    
**GOAL:** Distill your project idea into a short presentation to deliver to your peers for feedback and review. 
    
**FORMAT:** Slide presentation (with notes). 
    
**TECHNOLOGY:** Your favorite presentation software. 
    
**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 1.5 hours.

### PROCESS: 

Building off your answers to the [project description exercise](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/explore/2-project_description_exercise.md) and your [elevator pitch](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/explore/3-elevator_pitch_exercise.md), this exercise will marry the two into a final presentation to deliver to the group. This will feature your main project idea for the fellowship, explain the problem space, and talk about how your work will address that problem. Try to compose something with images rather than only text, and give yourself some presenter's notes to complement what might turn into a nice TED talk at some point.

The aim of this exercise is to work on packaging up your project idea and communicate your idea to a diverse audience, so that they can understand your proposal and provide useful feedback.

**Slide 1: Goals**
    
**Slide 2: Problem**

**Slide 3 - 5 : Your Solution & Approach**

**Slide 6: Key Milestones & Timeline**

**Slide 7: Asks & Needs**

Try to test it with some folks in your community.

For Participants: 

    Ask that they read the slides beforehand.

    Encourage them to have a look at the needs and asks (Slide 7). Have them come to the presentation with possible proposals / ideas / examples of how others are tackling similar issues.

    Circulate an etherpad for resources (like this slide deck), notes, and a place for questions. Copy over any asks, needs or remaining questions you'd like to flag to the group. Encourage participants to add their questions there, as well. What do they need to know to assist with this work?

    Set guidelines. Ask participants to come with constructive -not solely critical - commentary. We want to encourage critiques and hard looks but also remember that we're a team.
