###SUSTAINABILITY PLAN / CONTRIBUTOR PATHWAYS

**GOAL:** Add to your CONTRIBUTING.md document by putting a plan in place outlining how you'll interact and encourage contributors. This will help new volunteers understand how to get involved and level up, while also giving you a plan to pass your project on to strong contributors in the future.

**FORMAT:** A section of the CONTRIBUTING.md file in your repository.

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 30 mins - 1 hour.

**TECHNOLOGY:** Your favourite text editor and Markdown. Record and share your findings in your GitHub repository.


###BACKGROUND

This is a good opportunity to level up some of your promising contributors so that one day they can run their own open source project. When more researchers have this valuable skill, we'll see more open source experiments furthering science on the web! By delegating more work to others in your project, you create redundancy and have the option of passing on leadership of this project.

Generally, you can group contributors in three sections: *new*, *active* and *core*. Here's a description using a generic software project:

**New contributor**
This is anyone new to your project. They have filed a couple issues, joined in discussion or sent their first pull request.
* permissions: none
* responsibility: none
* recognition: welcome to the project! 

**Active contributor**
This person has made some good contributions, and may have started reviewing other contributions / working with other contributors.
* permissions: commit privilege to repository
* responsibility: review other contributions when tagged
* recognition: varies. Usually public thanks, special role or swag.

**Core contributor**
Idealy, anyone in this section is someone you would feel comfortable passing off your project to. They already lead a section of the project (maybe as a module maintainer), and have a strong contribution history 
* permissions: commit privilege. Maybe can also grant commit to others.
* responsibility: module maintainer, oversee all contributions to their module
* recognition: varies. Public thanks, role or swag.

On your project, what kinds of responsibilities and permissions can you give to a contributor? By defining these roles, you can help move contributors along this pathway.

###EXAMPLE

When your project is hosted on GitHub, you can grant commit privilege to others. This allows them to merge in new changes to the main repository. I can add information on who gets commit privilege to my CONTRIBUTING.md. This helps new volunteers understand the community and keeps active member accountable 

> **Commit privilege**: Commit privilege is granted to interested contributors who:
* have landed at least 3 pull request,
* reviewed at least 3 pull requests, and
* are in good standing with the community
* responsibility: Commiters are expected to review pull requests when flagged

###EXERCISE

Think of at least two roles you can have on your project. Define these in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Make sure you thank and reward contributors at each step!
