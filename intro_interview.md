###INTRO BLOG POST FOR FELLOWS (interview format)

**GOAL:** We want our community to know about you, where you are coming from, what inspires and motivates your work in open science, and what projects or potential projects you’re excited about. As part of encouraging conversation and engagement within the Fellows cohort, we’re asking you to collaborate on these posts and interview each other.  

**FORMAT:** Interview. Each fellow interviews another for ~30 minutes; you’re interviewed by a different person that the one you interview.

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 2 hours (30 mins prep, 30 mins scheduling/tech download and testing, 30 mins interviewing, 30 mins editing & admin etc)  

**TECHNOLOGY:** Recording audio  via Skype may be the best option; there are a number of apps/plugins for recording audio from Skype. No-cost options for Mac are limited, but free short-term trials of software is available. If you have another solution, please let us know. 

###PROCESS:
* Get your interview assignment from MSL (see section at the end of this document)
* Schedule interviews in the next week.
* Send MSL the recorded audio file; we will have the interviews transcribed and sent to you for editing
* Zannah is available assist with the editing the text for the blog post as needed. 
* Let us know if you have any questions!

###For INTERVIEWER:
* Do some homework! Review your interviewee’s intro presentation from Onboarding to refresh your memory.
* In advance, make notes on what you find most intriguing, inspiring, compelling, surprising, confusing, etc about your interviewee’s life and work. Use this interview as a way to really understand and engage with their approach, vision, motivation.
* Ask open ended questions “Tell me about x…” “How would you define x…?” “What is your vision for x?” “Why is x important to you?”;  avoid yes or no questions. 
* Feel free to follow up with “Why?” and “How” questions to clarify or go deeper on a topic.
* Let the interview be a conversation, keep it relaxed and personable. 
* Don’t fear tangents if they come up-- it’s OK to drift a bit if your interviewee seems to want to head in a direction that you didn’t have in mind
* Use the 80/20 rule: you should be listening 80% of the time, talking only 20%
* Have a pad and pen handy to jot down great question or insight comes to mind while your interviewee is speaking. 
* Have fun!

###For INTERVIEWEE:
* Get specific-- particular projects, concrete examples, real-world first person stories will help anchor your ideas and provide helpful detail.
