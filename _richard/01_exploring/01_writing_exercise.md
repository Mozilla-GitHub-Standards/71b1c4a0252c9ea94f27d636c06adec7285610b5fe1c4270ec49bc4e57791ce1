## Writing and reflection on problem/challenge

### 1. Free-write: problem/challenge (5 mins)

> *Remember, don’t start with the solution you’re imagining here, only the problem you want it to address. Try phrasing  your problem in jargon-free language, and be sure you’re defining all terms plainly-- what ie: what does “open” mean in this case? Take a step back and look at the roots of the problem. What’s contributing or compounding it. Are there underlying causes you need to consider, to be sure you’re targeting your solution effectively?*

Being a scientist is hard. Or rather, becoming one is hard. Actually, both are hard. Partly that's because science is fundamentally about discovering things we didn't know before. But in my experience, most of the "this is really difficult" feeling comes from the culture, tools and resources being impenetrable. For many years I felt constantly frustrated in my work, because I would try to figure out how to do a particular thing (that many people claimed was possible or even easy) and it would take me an inordinate amount of time and effort to finally achieve the thing I wanted. If I were less stubborn, I might have given up, and left with the feeling that I wasn't good enough to be a scientist.

The thing is that actually everybody is good enough to be a scientist. When scientists claim that some problem is solved, or that some challenge is easily surmountable, they are usually talking about some theoretical advance that is only meaningful to people deeply entrenched in the language, tools and culture of their very specific sub-field. When I felt confused and frustrated as a learner it wasn't because I was stupid, it was because what I was trying to take part in was not accessible.

Often I'll want to do a particular thing - say, teach some students about a particular topic - and I find myself writing materials from scratch that I *know* someone has written before. Google doesn't seem to know about anything that can help save me time, so I do the work. But it's such a waste of time and effort.

Jargon free attempt:

If someone wants to take part in science, we should make it as easy as possible for them to do so. Science *may* be inherently hard, but more often than not it's the poor design of the tools, resources and communities that makes it hard. We should be designing our tools, resources and communities so that it's very clear to people of all abilities and experiences how they can get involved - as a user, or a contributor. Stuff that scientists make should be so easy to find and reuse that nobody ever re-does work that has already been done by someone else, unless they specifically want to redo it.

Why is this happening?

Well, a fundamental fact about science is that there is a limited pool of funding. Everyone who wants to do science professionally is competing for a piece of that pool. There's not enough money to enable all scientists to work on whatever they fancy, and act however they like. So what happens is that scientists have to compromise - they have to focus on doing science in a way that makes them most likely to get more funding, or they (and all the people who work for them) will be out of a job. So we're in this situation where the decisions of people who fund science drive the entire culture. And of course the people who fund science are influenced by all sorts of things - in particular they are influenced by what existing successful scientists tell them is important. Unfortunately a lot of currently successful scientists have got where they are by seeking headlines, producing papers that try to capture the public imagination and generate attention.

So, what we end up with is scientists working in a way that generates those attention-grabbing papers as efficiently as possible, and not focusing on the things that make science really valuable to society: being careful and likely to get closer to the truth over time; making their results, tools and resources easily accessible to people; making it easy for other scientists to use their work, build on it, or to challenge it, or improve it.

There are probably many other cultural causes, but my best analysis right now is that the way science is measured and rewarded by funders is really driving the broken system we have now.

### 2. Free-write: scope and scale (5 mins)

> *Consider the decisions you’ve made (if any) about scope and scale (for example: “among undergraduates” or “in the UK.”) . Take the problem and shift your scope and scale (zoom in/out) to focus on a larger or smaller subset of users or behaviors. What changes when you do this?  What feels most manageable? What feels too complex, or too general? Are you seeing new audiences or users you didn’t imagine?*

I have actually not really made any decisions about scope and scale. I think the problem applies equally to the public (i.e. the entire world) who might want to learn science, as it does to experts in a particular field who might want to participate in improving a resource. It's interesting that there are many ways to tackle the problem, and probably the most crucial thing that varies between the different ways is the scope.

For example, let's take the entire public. If we think about the problem of accessiblity with them as the user, we are talking about ways to make the whole of science more easy to understand. So we might look at ways to automatically summarise scientific papers in non-technical language. Or we might try to create a platform for scientists to engage with the public and answer their questions. Or we might try to attack the problem at the source I previously identified, and change the way funders reward people so that they put emphasis on producing resources that are intelligible to non-scientists.

At the other end, let's take a single field of expertise and make the users people who are already experts in this field. We are then looking at ways to publicise a particular project within the field, or to make it appealing enough that all the experts want to take part. We're looking at the particular attributes of this field of expertise and thinking about how to make it as easy as possible for someone with this epxertise to get involved - which will look completely different (perhaps we might assume it's easier) than trying to get the public involved.

The two examples are making me think of this: as a scientist I am pretty much spending 20 hours a day thinking about my speciality. It consumes my working hours and a good portion of my non-working mental effort. I'm so deep in this thing that it's almost impossible to step back and remember what it was like to be someone who wasn't deep in it. So if I want to explain some technical detail to someone, whether they are in my field or not, I'm going to have to think about what it's like to *not be me*, but to be them, with their different experiences and world view. Maybe it's no easier to do that with another expert in my field (who is very unlikely to be exactly like me) than it would be with a member of the public who had never heard of my field.

### 3. Refine (3-5 mins)

> *Take a moment to narrow your problem statement down to one or two sentences.*

Science should be for the benefit of everyone. It should allow everyone to use it and take part in it if possible. We shouldn't be wasting any time redoing things that have already been done - we should reuse things made by others. Stuff made by scientists should be easy for people to use and contribute to.

### 4. Reflect (3-5 mins)

> *Are you finding any gaps in your understanding of the problem, your users, etc? Is research needed? List 3-5 areas where you might need more.*

1. I definitely don't completely understand what's driving the problem at all scales. Taking the 'scope change' exercise above and expanding it with research (discussion + reading, not new science) would be valuable.

2. There are so many different sets of users, but one thing is true for any project that has users: the user experience is key. I need to learn more about user experience design, beyond my current understanding which is mostly "we need to try to put ourselves in the mindset of a user, and design things that work for them".

3. My basic understanding of the problem could use a lot more work. The explanation I gave above is based on my own observations and experience, plus discussions with other people. Only in the last few months have I started seeking out contacts and resources that might help be understand the problem of accessiblity in science in a structured way. what I've found is that it's incredibly complex. Designing the most effective possible solution would take many more months of strategic learning, discussion and thinking - something I can do alongside making concrete progress on a project.

4. I am bad at empathy, which doesn't bode well for being good at user experience design. It's something that I have been constantly trying to improve for years, and have only made progress by learning what others feel or think in certain situations by asking them, reading about it, or carefully observing and trying to reason about it. If I am to start focusing on accessiblity, I'll need to rely on outside resources for understanding how to do it and not try to use my own empathy as the primary guide.

### 5. Brainstorm (2-5 mins)

> *Think of analogs. What are similar problems in other fields? What solutions have been tried? Did they work? Why/Why not?*

Other fields... well, my field is science. Other fields could be absolutely anything. I suppose fields that have faced challenges of access to information and comminty include journalism and government, teaching, and open source software.

Journalism is fundamentally about communicating information - in a way it's challenge is the 'public scope' level of what I'm talking about. Taking expert information, understanding it completely, then distilling out the true message so it can be understood by a non-expert. My knowlege of journalism as a field of study is very weak, but there must be a lot of resources about how to do this effectively.

Government has a similar challenge - taking complicated information and making it accessible. Those governments that have good intentions are conceivably trying to do what journalism does. Those with not-so-good intentions are trying to mislead. Perhaps best to focus on journalism (although journalism isn't exactly morally pure - nor is science for that matter).

Teaching - well, there are large branches of science dedicated to figuring out how to do this well. I've used some of this research to improve my own teaching. There must be a vast body of releveant knowledge.

Open source. Perhaps the most interesting because it's a community that fundamentally shares the principle of public service with science, in a way that is much less corruptible that journalism or government. So many things have been tried here, and the problems are so similar. Im particular FOSS communities have a serious diversity problem, and many have cultural problems that block access. I know there are a lot of projects in FOSS to actively combat this - things like codes of conduct, onboarding procedures, good governance, documentation, etc. Perhaps here there are the most parallels.

### 6. Free-write: transformation (5 mins)

*If this problem is solved, what does that look like? What do people do differently? What are the effects one week, one month, one year, ten years after this problem is solved? How does this change the transform the  broader culture? (Again, skip the solution for now and try to imagine only the outcome).*

The problem is solved: science is accessible in every way. What does this mean?

Members of the public who are particularly interested in science start to discover information that they couldn't before. Things that were swimming in jargon are suddenly clear to them, written in language they understand.

More technical non-scientists, for example programmers, engineers and farmers, are able to start using the results of science in their practical work. When a new scientific finding is made that could impact their work, they find out about it easily and can incorporate its insights easily.

Scientists can take results from other fields within science and apply them easily in their own work. People in very different fields whose work might be mutually useful can easily find one another and join forces.

Scientists in any given field can easily find the state-of-the art methods in their field, and incorporate them rapidly into their own work.

Science doesn't make anyybody feel stupid.

In a week, perhaps one small sub-field of science starts to become more accessible to people inside that field. In a month, people outside that field, but still scientists, are able to easily discover information about the tools and discoveries of that field. Within a year, anyone who is interested can find information about tools and discoveries in that field, described in their language and taking into account their experiences and expertise, and can incorporate that knowlege into their own work without having to remake things that others have already made. Within ten years, this whole experience has been translated to many fields of science - fields where it has not been replicated are being seen as outdated and slow. The standard is now to be universally accessible within days of a new scientific development.
