## BLOG POSTS / SPRINT PROGRESS REPORT

**GOAL:**  The aim of this exercise is build-in some documentation for your projects, progress reports (for single project folks), incremental evaluations on a sprint-by-sprint basis (for sprint-schedule folks). 

**FORMAT:**  Use the provided [Exit Forms](http://goo.gl/forms/I6ZRdpvWs7) from previous sprints/weeks to start, and try to draft at least one blog post/month, loosely-aligned to the prompts. This wil be linked to during our monthly Community Calls, so you can use those as milestones. 

**TECHNOLOGY**: Blog tool/IDE/CMS of choice for authoring a blog post.

**TIME TO COMPLETE:**  (45 min/month)

### PROCESS:

**SINGLE PROJECT**

Consider the past 4 weeks of work, and perhaps address the following questions in your monthly blog.

You can otherwise write the blog with whatever style or flourish suits, including links/images/media where appropriate.

* What did you tackle this month, what features or milestones did you make/meet?
* What/Who inspired you to work on this?
* Who did you collaborate with on the way, and how have they helped you move forward?
* What are some lessons learned, and modifications for future workweeks?
* How much closer are you to project completion?

Way to go, post your blog on your site, and email Zannah + Aurelia with the link!

**SPRINT-STYLE**

Consider the past two sprints (which should/could roughly align with 1 project completed collaboratively), and perhaps address the following questions in your monthly blog. 

You can otherwise write the blog with whatever style or flourish suits, including links/images/media where appropriate.

* What project did you tackle this month, what features or milestones did you make/meet?
* What/Who inspired you to work on this?
* Who did you collaborate with on the way, and how have they helped you move forward? 
* What did you learn?
* Would you move forward with this project, and if so, how so? Or are you ready to move on to the next project?
