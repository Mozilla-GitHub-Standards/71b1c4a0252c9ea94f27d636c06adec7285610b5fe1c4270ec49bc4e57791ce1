## PROJECT SCHEDULE (mapped to a calendar)

**GOAL:**  The aim of this exercise is to develop a weekly project schedule aligned with the broader “phases” outlined in the roadmapping document.  To develop this schedule you will break your project down into tasks, thinking about the amount of time needed to complete each task as well as considering any dependencies and additional supports required.  Upon completion of this exercise you will have a weekly picture of your project deliverables mapped to a calendar. 

Should you prefer a sprint structure on a few micro-projects, you can accordingly adapt the following exercise to accommodate that scheduling as well, some prompts are provided.

**FORMAT:**  Google spreadsheet as a working document, your favourite calendar tool and/or develop a roadmap document in GitHub.

**TIME TO COMPLETE:**  (2.0 - 2.5 hrs)

### PROCESS:  

1.  Identify tasks and group them based on the broader “phases” or “milestones” of the Fellows’ roadmap. If you are adopting a “sprint” approach, you might break align these phases with sprints.

2.  Assign an amount of time needed to complete each task. Again, assign perhaps 1 sprint to a group of features, or to a project.

3.  Working backwards from milestone dates, looking at any dependencies that may impact completion of any task, set a week-by-week schedule for the next months of the fellowship.

4.  Identify points where you may need help from others such as MSL team, a design team or individuals/groups in your institution or community.

5.  Review your schedule ensuring that it identifies where you will have “successes” related to things like “number of people reached”, or “number of sprints run”, etc.

6.  Enter your task into your favourite calendar software adding reminders.  Alternatively you can build a “roadmap” document similar to the Fellows roadmap in GitHub as per the roadmapping and technical requirements exercise.
