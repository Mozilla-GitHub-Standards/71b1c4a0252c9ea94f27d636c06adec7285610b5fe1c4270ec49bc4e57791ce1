*GOAL:* Write a blog post about the challenge(s) or problem(s) you hope to address throughout the fellowship. 

*FORMAT:* Post on MSL's blog

*TECHNOLOGY:* Wordpress. You should have usernames and logins via Abby. 

*TIME TO COMPLETE:* 1-2 hours (depending on how fast you write!)

Using your ideas and notes from the challenge exercise, write a blog post about what challenges/problems you hope to tackle.
The post should be no longer than 7oo words (short and sweet). Keep the tone casual, and be sure to use jargon-free or jargon-lite lanaguage so your ideas are accesible to as many of our readers as possible. Foundation Director Mark Surman’s blog is a great model/resource for writing good posts. The bolded statements, the bullet points, these “action items” he uses highlighs key ideas and makes takeaways evident. Feel free to inculde images, diagrams, etc-- the more visuals the better!
