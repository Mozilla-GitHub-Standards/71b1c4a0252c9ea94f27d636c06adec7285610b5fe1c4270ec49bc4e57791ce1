##Welcome to the 2015 Mozilla Fellows for Science Roadmap!

This roadmap provides you with a bit of structure for the fellowship... But we (MSL staff) invite this first class of fellows to feedback on what's here, help us learn what works and what doesn't, and revise and refine this structure so best supports your communities and projects. 

Over the next 10 months, you'll create amazing projects, build communities, train our next set of open science leaders, and champion working open and open science in ways that we haven't yet dreamed of. 


###FELLOWSHIP MISSION/VISION STATEMENT
(fellows pls add)


###TASKS/DELIVERABLES

We've broken the 10 month period into phases, to help you organize your time. Deliverables are for each phase of the project will be listed as that phase nears, and sorted into directories named for the phase. The deliverables will help you document your project's evolution, and make your process transparent and reusable for our wider community. We've assigned point people ([contact list here](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/reference/contacts.md)) who can help you with questions and clarifications about the task, so look for their names in the Deliverable section. 

See below for a color-coded calendar of the year. All is subject to change/updating. Again, your feedback is welcome!
