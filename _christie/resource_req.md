# Resource requirements #


The purpose of this course is threefold- 
1. To teach a set of students open science skills
2. To develop curriculum which can be taught through a distributed teaching model
3. To provide an infrastructure for analyzing orphan data

## Physical/technological requirements ##
The OSRR course requires very few physical things- we'll be using free software for all aspects of the course. Essentially, we need internet access, computer equipment, a space to meet, and willing students, which will all be provided by MSU. Swag from Mozilla/ OS projects would be great to distribute to students upon successful completion of the course

Oooh, wait. A microphone. I think a microphone would be handy for recording discussions.

## Other Resources ##

The main things I need help with are content generation, and expert discussion facilitators. 

Content will primarily come from Data/Software carpentry lessons for technical skills, and in the form of read-ahead web content or more prescriptive exercises that students will be expected to read over before coming to class.

Discussion facilitators serve several purposes- the idea is they'll provide expert perspective as the class discusses a philosophical aspect of open science in real time, but we will also record the conversations and make them available online for people who wish to follow the course from home, or use them in a future offering of OSRR.

Down the road, we will need data contributors and instructors.

*Resource requirements matrix*


Role | Output/Input | Hours Needed (per week/ongoing) | Who Can Help? | Notes
---- |------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -----
Content generators| Course content/relevant links and materials| ongoing | MSL staff, members of OS community | I will ask expert discussion facilitators to help out with content for their particular discussion
Discussion facilitators | A 20-40 minute video interaction with students |~2 hours per discussion, with prep time|MSL staff, members of OS community|
Data Contributors| Orphaned data|Depends on format of data, how much metadata is available| Late career scientists| Should create a simple web interface to recruit
Instructor | Teaching the course to new young minds| As much time as they're willing to give| SWC/DC community|Ideally, anyone who wants to teach OSRR can take up all or a portion of the course
