## **An interview with Joey Lee** ##

*Joey Lee is a Mozilla Fellow for Science and a MSc student at the University of British Columbia. In December 2015, we sat down for a chat about who he is, what motivates him, and why he's interested in open science.* 

**So tell me about yourself. How did you get where you are?**

How did I get where I am? I was born in the San Francisco Bay 
area in a city called Vallejo. My parents emigrated to the U.S. from Korea back in the 1980's.  When I started university, I started at UCLA in art as my major. I quickly realized I wasn't solely interested in art, but also in the sciences. So I ventured out and eventually fell into geography, as is the case for most geographers. 
Geography gave me an opportunity to learn a little bit of economics, a little bit of urban planning and environmental science, which is what I ended up sticking to in the end.

However what really changed my life was when I started doing field research during my bachelors and  got a chance to go to Puerto Rico and study tropical soils. That experience showed me the methods of science and how deep into the rabbit's hole you can go. It was this eye-opening experience of like, “Wow,  if you have this idea that is relevant for the world, you can really deep dive and make things happen.” I found that super fascinating.
 
At the end of my undergrad I had this respect procedural science and experimentation and an deep interest in cities and visual communication which led me to pursuing a research assistantship at MIT. With the MIT Senseable City lab, we were taking big data sets from cities and trying to parse them down into things that people can associate with. And because it's an urban planning/architecture/design/science lab, the visuals were great and the research was great. It was a really great mix of researchers from physicists, architects , engineers, social scientists, and artists so it was really a nice environment to just explore the collaborative aspect of science. 

It was also at MIT that I met my good friend Benedikt Gross. He and I worked on a bunch of projects around data and geography, like the Big Atlas of LA Pools where we looked for all the pools in Los Angeles and the collaboration just grew from there.  From this collaboration I began to see where data could start to be a vehicle for talking about complex topics and communicating about them to wider audiences. This fascination propelled me to pursue a master's. 
At the same time with all this data stuff, I found myself getting more interested in how people affect cities in a physical way (e.g. the urban climate) and the urban climate community offered me that outlet to, use instruments and sensors to actually see what the impact would be and link that back to climate change. I found the multi-scalar approach of urban climate research to be super cool so then I started at UBC in Vancouver. I've been there for the last two years, hopefully finishing my thesis soon.

**No pressure!**

No pressure. And you know. So life has been a lot of exploration 
trying to figure out what exactly I want to do. But I have to say that the urban climate community is one that I feel at home with and they're all super nice. 

**Awesome. So skateboarding was a really important part of your background. How did you get into it?** 

Yeah. Yeah. So...so it all started...actually, I think I was in seventh grade, and I was on the baseball team in my middle school. And I remember looking into the parking lot during one of our games (It kind of shows you that I wasn't that great at baseball.) I looked at the parking lot and my friend's brother was just skating around, having a great time. And I thought, “Man, I want to do that. That looks cool.” And that was it. After the baseball game, I went to my friend's house still wearing my baseball uniform, and he taught me how to skateboard. We just put the skateboard in a crack in the sidewalk and he said do an ollie. You know, like do a little jump. And so that was it. I was hooked. And basically from that point on, all I was doing was skating and thinking about skating and watching skate videos. I didn't really have much of a life outside of that, I think, for many, many years. 

**So do you still skateboard?**

Yes. So still actively skating. It's weird because I feel like I have a very meta understanding of how skating is a way to reappropriate space. You know, it's kind of morphed into this more academic understanding of it. 

**And so you're now interested in urban climate issues- and Vancouver is really a cool and exciting place to be working on it.  Can you tell me a bit more about how that project came about?**

The day that I arrived at UBC, we got the notice that we didn't get the grant for the work we were planning, so my supervisor said, “Hey, so you can basically do whatever you want”. I basically put together a Power Point presentation of just like beautiful images of cities and maps that I really loved, and tried to use that as like a springboard for what we could produce, you know, as like a visual output for something that we measured. Kind of maybe a backwards way of doing things, but I presented this at one of my committee meetings, and one of my supervisors was like, “Hey, that map is really beautiful. How could we get outside of the box and like really think of weird ways of understanding the climate in cities? Could we could build sensors to measure pollutants?”...   We just took the opportunity to build the thing with open source stuff. 

I think we’re in this  transition with in the realm of environmental sensing especially with all these open source microcontrollers coming out, and the documentation becoming really great. This is a big contrast from all this hardcore scientific equipment that’s all locked down proprietary stuff to now being able to make your own GPS and data loggers, 

**Cool. So you mentioned open source.. So how is open source and open science in general important to you?**

Ah, this is a big one. I think in the end it comes down to, access, participation and 
opportunity. Or like in any good murder mystery show, it's about means, motive, and opportunity. I think open science and open source provide the means to do science.  Open source makes sure that you have access to the right tools for the research that you want to do. For me the motive to do open science is lies in community building so that the public has access to science and that domain scientists can build on our work.  What’s super, super important to me is that everyone can participate and that if you want to learn about something or contribute to a greater quest for knowledge, you can. 

I think what open source and open science is doing is making new opportunities to do the things that you want to do. I grew up in a very prescriptive environment about how to learn but with open science/open source you get exposed to all of the millions of possibilities that are out there and to find the right learning and research tools for you. I think it's been incredibly empowering and satisfying to start to build things that in my brain were just an idea. Now with open tools, you can just simply do it.

So why should we practice open science?

I think a lot of people simply see the outcome of science as being this big and overwhelming thing. I think if people saw how science actually gets done they could develop a very different picture of what it means to do science. We need to make science more transparent. If we saw how people collect insects, for example, you would see that while yes, it is scientific, it's also just a bunch of people out there just busting their ass. If people were to see that, it would kind of open up the doors for more diversity in science. For example, if you're interested in technology and not necessarily interested in particle physics, you can still participate in science and play, actually, an amazing role as a developer or as a designer to help make sense of all that stuff. And so in the end for me I think bringing more diversity into science through building confidence or educational materials could be like a really good way to incentivize open science. 

**How are you going to use your Mozilla fellowship?**

Joey: 		I've spent a lot of time on this, and you know, it's been really great to have 
this time to explore. It's also been, horrifying because all of the ideas that I've come up with either I decided to trash or they've already been done. So I'm kind of still brainstorming at the moment. Richard and I have also been thinking of collaborating. And it's looking like that  collaboration most likely be the modus operandi for the next 10 months or so. But the idea for me, at least, is for me on the one hand to come up with a new GIS education or new way to learn maps. I think mapping is a huge space to bring a diverse range of people into science to do cool stuff, and also as a communication tool. I've kind of got this idea for making mapping more accessible for people who want to make maps can learn how to do make them on the web. 

**And on that note, say you're a novice in the world of GIS, and you want to start out with tools that are open source... Where do you start?**

 I think it depends at which point you want to engage in the GIS to start. On one hand you can start by just mapping stuff to visualize it. There's now tons of web tools out there, like CartoDB or mapbox. But then as far as doing the data handling, now there's  libraries in R and Python or QGIS. The coolest thing is that you can even do all this in straight-up JavaScript. I think this is really cool because you can do all of your geo-processing and visualization right in the browser. But anyways, to start in the world of GIS, I would say start programming. GIS in the end is just like computer science. It's just data tables with polygons and learning how to manipulate and throw data around. And while that sounds really intimidating and scary when you start to break it down with little examples (e.g. here's how you load the data, etc) You start to learn these generic skills, and I think that is more important than simply being able to do lots of complex map stuff immediately. However all that being said, I think QGIS is an amazing project and that's where I would start in the open source realm. There's like lots of tools out there. There's one now that's like lego blocks for maps and you can lego block your geo-process together and it’s all done in the browser! All these things are emerging right now so I think it's a really interesting time to kind of hop on that.

**Well, that's very exciting.**

Yeah. 

**I'm looking forward to working with you in the future because I've got lots of problems that I think you can solve. It's been great talking to you.**

Yes, super nice chatting.
