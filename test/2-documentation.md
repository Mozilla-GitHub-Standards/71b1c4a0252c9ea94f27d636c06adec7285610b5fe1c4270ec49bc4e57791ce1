##Documentation

**GOAL:** This exercise will help you document your projects, or guide you through some exercises that will help you think critically about the kinds of documentation you might need.

**FORMAT:** Markdown or text document

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 30 mins - 1 hour.

**TECHNOLOGY:** Your favorite text editor or Markdown viewer. Record and share your findings in your GitHub repository.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Choose a project, one that you've developed, or published, and consider the following bullets as you do a documentation audit of that project. Take notes on as you address these bullets in your makdown document, and save it to your folder.

#### Consider your audience
* maybe reference your [sustainability plan](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/explore/2-sustainability_plan.md) or [challenge exercise](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/explore/1-challenge_exercise.md) from the Explore phase, if relevant
* list a few groups you might like to engage in your project or incorporate into the community that uses your project
* sort these people/groups into "**Contributors**" and "**Users**" lists

#### Draft an intro
* draft a short message to your contributors or users summarizing your project in one sentence and defining the type of contribution you'd like to solicit from them
* this may develop into a more robust [contributor.md file](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/) or a little [website for your community](http://www.slidewinder.io/docs/) but for now it can be a draft text document.

#### Create basic docs
* draft some boilerplate documents that correspond to your project, which you can evolve over time
	* **License**: [guide here](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) - instructions about how your project can be shared/reused
	* **Readme**: [guide here](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/writing_readme/) - brief details about your project, now to install/deploy/use it and what purpose it serves
	* **Code of Conduct**: [guide here](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/code_of_conduct/) - guide to welcome and unwelcome behavior
	* **Contributor file**: [guide here](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/) - how to contribute or participate in your project/community

#### Publish and evolve
* find an appropriate place to publish these documents and link them to your project -- they might just be footnotes on documentation associated with your work, or they might be a separate github repository of referenced standards for your project, or they might be on the website for your project. 
* choose a place that's easily findable for your target audience
* review the resources referenced below for style guidelines and design patterns that can help you guide your documentation
* consider incorporating screenshots or useful examples that punctuate general documentation with some flavor and visual interest, as [suggested in this guide to what not to do with docs](http://blog.smartbear.com/careers/13-things-people-hate-about-your-open-source-docs/)
* consider also offering your docs in other (not only online) formats, as you can do with [helpndoc](http://www.helpndoc.com/) and other free tools that offer multiple documentation exports
