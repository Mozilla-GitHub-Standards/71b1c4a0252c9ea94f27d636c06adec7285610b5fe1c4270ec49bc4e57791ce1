##Event Planning and Launch

**GOAL:** Even when your projects and assets are essentially digital, it's important to find opportunities to talk to your users, demo for them, and test/observe your application in the wild. This exercise is meant to give you tips on planning an event/meetup/talk to debut your project.

**FORMAT:** Markdown or text document

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 30 mins - 1 hour.

**TECHNOLOGY:** Your favorite text editor or Markdown viewer. Record and share your findings in your GitHub repository.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

* Decide how you would like your to launch your project, and sketch out a timeline of notes with the rough dates of launch and promotion, maybe something like:

August 15 - complete project repository and documentation
August 20 - tweet polished project on social media
August 25 - seek 5 contributors to the project, or testers to review your work
...

* Make a list of elible conferences, events, or hackathons where you could potentially debut your project
* Add these events to the timeline sketch above
* Start outreach to the event organizers, or conference committee, and draft a quick abstract about your project (maybe cull it from your README or documentation developed in the "Documentation" exercise)
* Host your own event/launch, possiblity in coordination with another group or meetup who does cool stuff in your area, check out these [facilitation guidelines](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/sprints_events/) for tips, checklists and resources to make this happen
* Consider building a Study Group around your project topic, to build and manage IRL community (*nudg nudge* sorry, not sorry)


Load all of these notes into a document with a relevant title in your repository folder/branch and conclude the document with the details for an event, conference or talk you would like to give in honor of your project debut.
