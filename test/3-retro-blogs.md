##Blogging

**GOAL:** This exercise will provide you with brief prompts for a short blog about your fellowship experience, which we'll post throughout the month of June as we prep new and incoming fellows for their experience and process applications for the next co-hort

**FORMAT:** Markdown or text document

**TIME TO COMPLETE:** 30 mins - 1 hour.

**TECHNOLOGY:** Your favorite text editor or Markdown viewer. Record and share your findings in your GitHub repository.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

We'd love for you to write a quick blog about what you did during yoru fellowship and what the experience brought to you personally an professionally. We'll post them weekly starting in June, on the Tuesday or Thursday depending on your schedules, with the following (loose) schedule in mind:

**Joey**: Week of June 6th
**Jason**: Week of June 13th
**Christie**: Week of June 20th
**Richard**: Week of June 27th

We'll also invite you to talk about your experience on the Community Call (June 9th), so make sure to mark your calendars for that.

Prompts and the schedule are documented in [this etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/fellowship-blogs) with pointers recopied here for your convenience.

Keep in mind:

* Be focused and personal. This can take many forms. Pick a specific project you've really enjoyed. Photos from an event or fellowship-related trip. Some question you've really been grappling with. 

* Define your audience. There's a real opportunity here to speak to very specific audiences in a way that does not have to appeal to a broad audience as well (I can do that with the weekly roundup). So who do you want to speak to? Python enthusiasts? Developers vexed by the future of science? (Bonus points: If this audience has an online presence, please let us know lists/groups/individuals to reach out to for sharing your post.

* Keep it brief and specific. Once you've identified your focus and audience, just stick to that. Don't worry about looping in every other possible tangent.

* Watch your language. This is totally up to you. If you want to write it in a special format or another language, please let us know and we'll help clone/mirror/translate it (Give us at least five days' notice for translation, please!)


* Add some visuals. Complementing your text with a few images, or documentation of your experience, is a great way break up paragraphs add visual interest to your blogs

* Consider the format. Two paragraphs and bullet points or links are totally acceptable, the format is pretty fluid.
